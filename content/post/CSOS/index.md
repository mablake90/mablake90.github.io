We have demonstrated that a class of quantum circuits that exihibits operator scrambling can be classically simulated by a novel technique.

<!--more-->

Operator Scrambling refers to the process by which simple observables evolve in the Heisenberg picture to become complex observables distributed across many degrees of freedom. This process is a characteristic signature of quantum chaos, and it is therefore widely believed to be hard to simulate on a classical computer. Nonetheless, recent work by Dr Mike Blake and Professor Noah Linden, has lead to the development of a novel technique that allows for the simulation of operator scrambling for a specific class of quantum circuits.

Follow up work by Dr Mike Blake, Professor Noah Linden, and Anthony Thompson, has demonstrated the class of circuits that can be simulated using this technique includes fast scramblers.
