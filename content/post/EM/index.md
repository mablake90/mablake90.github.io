We have identified novel connections between entanglement dynamics during black hole evaporation and the thermalization of isolated quantum systems.

In the last few years our group has been interesting in establishing a precise connection between two seemingly distinct questions in physics – firstly, the fate of quantum information during the evaporation of a black hole and secondly the thermalization of a many-body quantum system. In both cases, the key goal is to understand the dynamics of the quantum entanglement between different parts of the system – in gravity, this is between the black hole and its radiation, whilst in the many-body quantum system it is between different spatial regions. In particular, in [4] we studied toy models of black holes and radiation built out of many-body quantum systems. In these models we were able to use a technique known as the entanglement membrane, which provides a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics in generic chaotic systems, to derive the expected features of entanglement in black hole-radiation systems. These include a derivation of the Page curve, describing the entropy of Hawking radiation, and studies of the Hayden-Preskill protocol. The key point is these behaviours arose due to transitions in the entanglement membrane, in a close analogue of the way in which they arise in gravity due to transitions between distinct quantum extremal surfaces. In [5], we established a direct quantitative connection between the entanglement membrane and these quantum extremal surfaces in holographic studies of black hole information using `double holography’.
