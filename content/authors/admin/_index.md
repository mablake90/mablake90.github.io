## About Me

I am a mathematical physicist working at the intersection of high energy theory, gravity and quantum physics. The main goal of my research is to use quantum field theory and string theory techniques to gain new insights into quantum many-body dynamics. Much of my research makes use of holography, which provides a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories that have a dual description in terms of the physics of black holes in anti-de Sitter space.

Full details of my publications can be found at any of the websites listed below:

My research group is currently funded by United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) through the UK Government's Horizon Europe Guarantee Scheme, Grant No. EP/Y00468X/1, `Strongly Interacting Quantum Dynamics'.
